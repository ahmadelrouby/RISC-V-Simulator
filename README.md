# RISC-V-Simulator


This simulator was designed in C++ and it simulates the RISC V processor.

The simulator reads a binary file containing RISC-V compatible instructions and executes one by one while displaying the instruction in assembly and hexadecimal. At the end, the simulator displays the int registers with all the contents.
